The scripts in this repository are related to the manuscript [Ligand binding remodels protein side chain conformational heterogeneity](https://elifesciences.org/articles/74114). 

A corresponding blog post about tricks and tips about running a structural bioinformatic pipeline can be found [here]().

Scripts are organized into four categories:
1) PDB Selection 
2) Refinement, Creation of Multiconformer Models
3) Quality Control
4) Analysis
