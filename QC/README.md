Quality Control

1) Determine differences in R-free between different refinement steps.
2) Calculate clashscore from qFit refined structures.
3) Align structures together.
4) Re-label chains and re-number structures based on apo structure.
5) Determine alpha Carbon RMSD between structures.
6) Deterine RMSD between ligand of interest and other ligands in apo structure.
