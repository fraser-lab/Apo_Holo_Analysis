Quality Control

Many of the analysis called within these scripts are from the [qFit repository] (https://github.com/ExcitedStates/qfit-3.0).

1) Determine differences in R-free between different refinement steps.
2) Calculate clashscore from qFit refined structures.
3) Align structures together, re-label chains and re-number structures based on apo structure, determine alpha Carbon RMSD between structures.
6) Deterine RMSD between ligand of interest and other ligands in apo structure.
