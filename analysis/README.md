This folder contains scripts used to assess the dynamics and other properties of the structures in our dataset. 

Many of the analysis called within these scripts are from the [qFit repository] (https://github.com/ExcitedStates/qfit-3.0).

To run all analysis scripts, use the analysis_wrapper.sh.

Additionally, run_hbplus.sh can be used to look at hydrogen bond changes within multiconformer structures using [HBplus](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/software/HBPLUS/).
